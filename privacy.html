          protected by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place such
          as: EU approved model clauses (which can be found

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">Data protection</h2>

        <p class="text">
          All user data supplied to Click is sent to the cloud and stored in the
          Click database, which is carefully protected with the latest
          encryption and secure authentication technologies.

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">Data usage</h2>

        <p class="text">
          Click Social LLC will process and utilize user-supplied data as it
          deems fit, in order to provide users with the best experience possible

        <p class="text">
          The lawful basis for our use of your information is the contractual
          necessity of providing dating, event, and social networking services
          to you as a user. To opt out from anything but marketing emails, you
          must delete your account.

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">Data visibility</h2>

        <p class="text">
          All data that you submit should be considered public, and may be
          displayed publicly, except where the scope of information disclosure
          is obviously limited (e.g. in the case of private messages sent to
          just one other user). The visibility of the following types of
          information is limited:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="text">
            Your precise user location is never shown to any user. What is shown
            publicly is only your town or city, and an approximate distance from
            the user viewing your profile (this distance is fuzzed and rounded
            to the nearest 5km, and distances under 10km are not shown).
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Messages and dating notes are only shown to the intended recipients,
            for example users you have matched (clicked) with, for a dating chat
            channel, or users who are confirmed for the same event as you, for
            an event chat channel.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Your age is not shown publicly; however, people may be able to
            determine your age indirectly, by filtering for different age
            ranges, and seeing whether your profile is visible or not.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Details of your religious practice (beyond your religious identity
            itself) are only shown to users of the opposite sex who share your
            religion, as indicated during account creation and editing.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Dating-relevant profile attributes (as determined by Click Social
            LLC, and as indicated during account creation and editing) are only

            their profile.

          and others.

        <p class="text">
          We will take all reasonable measures to protect your data. Other than
          the display of your data in the normal process of providing Click

          except in response to lawful and valid law enforcement requests for
          disclosure (as detailed below), or as needed to provide requested
          services (such as sharing your identity and payment information with
          payment processors and social login providers).
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          Your information may be accessed by moderators or system
          administrators for troubleshooting purposes, or in order to ensure the

          another user complains about your behavior. We reserve the right to
          block any user at any time, at our discretion, for repeated or
          subsantiated reports of bad behavior.

          Click Social LLC will make every effort to protect all user data from
          hacking, theft, and exfiltration. However, by agreeing to use the
          Click service, you agree to not submit any data you personally feel is
          sensitive. Consequently, you indemnify Click Social LLC and its
          representatives and stakeholders against any inadvertent leak or
          disclosure of your data.

        <h3 class="sub-heading3 text-orange">Account deletion</h3>

        <p class="text">
          You have the right to delete your account at any time, through the
          Click app. Go to: Click Profile &gt; Settings &gt; Account management
          &gt; Delete account. Your profile and other data you submit will
          immediately become unviewable to other users.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          An archived copy of your data may be kept for a limited period after
          account deletion (e.g. 90 days) to comply with legal requirements for
          compliance with legal discovery and law enforcement requests.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading3 text-orange">
          Data retention after account deletion
        </h3>

        <p class="text">
          By law, we must retain certain business-related data about your
          account even if you delete your account, including for tax and
          accounting purposes.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          To keep users of Click safe, we may indefinitely retain a set of user
          identity data even after account deletion (which may include, but is
          not necessarily limited to, name, date of birth, ID verification data,
          contact information, payment information, demographics, and facial
          recognition vectors), to allow us to enforce anti-harrassment,
          anti-fraud, and anti-spam measures, to allow us to keep banned users
          out of Click, and to enable Click Social LLC to comply with law
          enforcement requests even after account deletion.
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-heading3 text-orange">
          Deletion of individual data items
        </h3>

        <p class="text">
          If you would like to delete individual data items from your account,
          you may do this through the Click app, where you can view or delete
          any of your data. For profile items that are marked as mandatory, you
          cannot delete the item, but you can replace it with a non-sensitive
          value if you prefer to remove it.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          If you have a more specific deletion request that you somehow can't
          fulfill through the Click app, you may submit your request to
          <a href="mailto:support+datadeletion@clicksocial.app"
            >support+datadeletion@clicksocial.app</a
          >, and we will do our best to comply with your request. Note that we
          cannot guarantee a timeline or any particular outcome from manual
          requests like this, except in cases of an app bug that prevents you
          from deleting the data you want to delete, since otherwise, you have
          the ability to delete all your data yourself through the Click app.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">Law enforcement requests</h2>

        <p class="text">
          To protect user safety, we comply with all valid and lawful law
          enforcement requests for information. These requests must be made from

          legality. We will challenge law enforcement requests that are overly
          broad, incomplete, of dubious origin, or not lawful.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          The sender of a low enforcement request will be verified directly by
          contacting the law enforcement agency in question by phone, via the
          phone number listed on the official website of the requesting law
          enforcement agency. We cannot comply with law enforcement requests if
          the requesting or agency cannot be contacted by phone to verify the
          request, through information provided on the official website of the
          law enforcement agency.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          When a valid law enforcement request is received, we will disclose the
          minimum amount of information necessary to comply with the law
          enforcement request.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          We will document all law enforcement requests that are received,
          including the requests themselves, any action taken in response to law
          enforcement requests, and the legal reasoning and actors involved.
