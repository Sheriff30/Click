        <h1 class="sub-heading text-orange">Click Terms of Service</h1>

        <p class="text">
          Welcome to Click ("the Click app"), a social circle app developed by
          Click Social LLC. By accessing or using Click, you agree to be bound
          by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read these Terms carefully
          before using the App. These Terms govern your access to and use of the
          App and any services provided through the App.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <p class="text">
          By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms and our
          Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms or our Privacy
          Policy, you may not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">2. Description of the App</h2>

        <p class="text">
          Click is a social circle app that combines events, social media
          posting, and online dating functionalities into one platform. The App
          allows users to discover and attend events, connect with other users,
          share posts, and explore potential romantic connections.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">3. Eligibility</h2>

        <p class="text">
          Click is a private community, meaning it is not open without
          restriction to the public. Instead, Click is only open for use by
          people who meet and comply with the following criteria. By creating an
          account on Click, you witness and agree that all of the following
          conditions are true for you, and that you will continue to adhere to
          these restrictions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="text">You are at least 18 years old.</li>
          <li class="text">
            You are not married or separated, and you are not a swinger. If you
            are getting divorced, your divorce must be final before you use
            Click. You agree and acknowledge that Click is a community for
            singles only.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            You will not use Click as a "hookup app". You agree and acknowledge
            that Click is a community for singles seeking deeper connection with
            others.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            You have never been convicted of a felony, domestic violence, or a
            sex offense.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            You accept that Click Dating features are available only to people
            who are interested in traditional dating (man seeking woman, or
            woman seeking man). Click Social LLC only has the resources to cover
            traditional dating, and you acknowledge that you have the freedom to
            choose other dating apps (Hinge, Tinder, or Bumble) if you have more
            diverse identity needs or more diverse dating interests. Note that
            Click Social and non-dating Click Events features are open to all
            singles, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.
            (However, regardless of sexual identity or orientation, it is a
            violation of the terms of service to create events that are sexual
            in nature or that are for the express purpose of finding hookup
            partners.)
            <p class="text"></p>
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            You have read, fully understand, and agree to all terms in this
            Click Terms of Service document, and in the
            <a href="privacy.html">Click privacy policy</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">
          If at any point any of these conditions no longer apply to you (e.g.
          you get married, or you become convicted of a felony, domestic
          violence, or a sex offense, or you no longer agree to the terms of
          service) then you agree to immediately delete your Click account and
          desist from using Click.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading2 text-orange">4. User Accounts</h2>

          information during the registration process and to update such
          information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You are
          responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
          credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You
          agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account
          or any other breach of security.
